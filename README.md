<h1 align="center">Sortix</h1>
<p align="center"><strong>An intelligent, privacy-first, real-time file organizer for your desktop.</strong></p>
<p align="center">Sortix runs quietly in the background, monitoring your Downloads and custom folders. It automatically classifies and files incoming documents, media, and archives using visual Scratch-like rules, content OCR, EXIF/ID3 metadata, or an optional 100% local LLM.</p>

## 💡 Why Sortix?

Let’s be honest: your Downloads folder is probably an endless dumping ground of PDFs, invoices, screenshots, zip files, and music downloads. Manually moving them takes time, and cloud-based file organizers compromise your privacy.

Sortix handles sensitive personal files (tax returns, bank statements, contracts, photos) right on your machine. It is designed **privacy-first from day one**:

* **100% Local Execution:** Zero cloud dependencies, zero telemetry, and zero external API calls. Your documents never leave your localhost.
* **Smart Content Classification:** Deep scans text in PDF, DOCX, and TXT files, and performs local OCR on images using Tesseract.
* **Strict Security Controls:** Safe path resolution strictly confined to your home directory (`~`), built-in anti-loop guards, anti-Zip-Slip protections for archives, and local API token protection.

## ✨ Features at a Glance

### 🎨 Desktop UI & Global i18n
* **Windows 11 Dark Matte Interface:** Modern dark aesthetic, interactive 2D folder cards, custom WebKit scrollbars, responsive topbar layout, and smooth Ctrl + wheel zoom scaling.
* **Circular View Transitions Theme Toggle:** Smooth 1.2s circular theme toggle expansion animation originating directly from the button click position.
* **Global Multi-Language Support (6 Languages):** Native auto-detection and live switching for English (EN), Spanish (ES), Chinese (ZH), Hindi (HI), French (FR), and German (DE).
* **Dedicated Local AI (Ollama) Panel:** Configure 100% local LLM settings for smart classification fallback and automated rule learning without cloud dependencies.

### 🚀 Real-Time Automation & Multi-Folder Patrol
* **Multi-Folder Real-Time Monitoring:** Monitors your Downloads directory and any active custom folders simultaneously in real-time. Safely waits for active downloads (`.crdownload`, `.part`) to complete before filing.
* **Background Task Scheduler:** Automatically runs periodic folder sweeps and scheduled auto-trash cleanups in the background without blocking the UI.
* **Native Desktop Notifications:** Sends non-intrusive system notifications whenever a file is filed or organized.

### 🧠 Smart Classification & Learning
* **Visual Scratch-Style Rule Builder:** Combine filename, extension, file size, age (`age_days`), and content conditions with AND logic.
* **Smart Learning from Corrections:** Corrected a file placement manually? Sortix analyzes the correction (via heuristic patterns or your optional local Ollama LLM) and suggests a new rule with a single click.
* **Archive Handling (.zip / .tar):** Safely unpacks compressed archives in temporary sandboxes with Zip-Slip protection to analyze and organize internal contents.
* **EXIF & ID3 Tag Metadata:** Filter and rename files using photo EXIF data (camera model, capture date) and audio ID3 tags (artist, album, song title, year).
* **Dynamic Placeholders:** Custom file renaming templates using tags like `{YYYY}`, `{Topic}`, `{ARTIST}`, `{ALBUM}`, `{EXIF_DATE}`, and `{OriginalName}`.

### 🛠️ Utilities & Desktop Experience
* **Fast 2-Step Deduplication:** Quickly detects duplicate files across any selected directory using a lightweight 2-pass hashing approach (64KB fast-hash + full SHA256 verification).
* **Export & Import Rules:** Export your custom classification and maintenance rules to JSON files to share or backup.
* **Dry-Run Simulation:** Test how your rules will handle existing files before committing any actual moves.
* **1-Level Undo:** Accidental move? Undo filing actions directly from your History log.
* **Standalone Desktop App & 1-Click Packaging:** Run as a native desktop window via `pywebview` or package into a standalone binary using the built-in PyInstaller builder script.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* **Python 3.10+**
* (Optional) **Tesseract OCR** for image text scanning.
* (Optional) **Ollama** (`SORTIX_LLM=1`) for local AI fallback suggestions.

### Quick Run
```bash
git clone https://github.com/marcmarti9/sortix.git
cd sortix/backend

# Create environment and install dependencies
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run server
python main.py
```
Open your browser at `http://127.0.0.1:5000` to access the dashboard.

To launch in desktop app window mode:
```bash
python desktop.py
```

---

## 📦 Building a 1-Click Desktop Executable

Want a standalone executable binary without needing a Python setup?

```bash
cd backend
python build_desktop.py
```
The compiled binary will be placed inside `backend/dist/`.

---

## 🖥️ Native Desktop App & Autostart Setup

Sortix can run as a **native standalone desktop application** (in its own dedicated window without any web browser UI) and start automatically whenever you log into your PC:

### Automatic Desktop & Startup Installation (Linux)
```bash
cd backend/deploy
./install_autostart_desktop.sh
```
This registers Sortix in your desktop application menu (`~/.local/share/applications/sortix.desktop`) and sets it to auto-launch on startup (`~/.config/autostart/sortix.desktop`).

### Linux Service (Headless systemd user service)
```bash
cd backend/deploy
./install_linux.sh
```

### macOS (LaunchAgent)
```bash
cd backend/deploy
./install_macos.sh
```

### Windows (Scheduled Task)
```powershell
cd backend\deploy
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File install_windows.ps1
```

*(To uninstall services, run the corresponding `./uninstall_...` script in `backend/deploy/`.)*

## 🧪 Testing

Sortix features a comprehensive, isolated integration test suite:

```bash
cd backend
.venv/bin/python tests/test_all.py
```
